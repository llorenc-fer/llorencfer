This GitHub repository contains an exploratory data analysis and machine learning prediction model for the Titanic Dataset. Our goal is to perform an examination of the data and build a robust and accurate model to predict the survival of the passengers.

The repository is organized into several sections, including general exploratory data analysis, survival data statistics, and model evaluation. We use Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly Express and Sklearn to implement our analysis and model building process.

In the exploratory data analysis section, we aim to understand the structure and relationships within the data, as well as identify any patterns or trends that could inform our model building process. 

Finally, in the model deployment, we evaluate its performance using various metrics and let the user input data of a hypothetical passenger and check if it would survive.

We hope that this repository serves as a helpful resource for anyone looking to gain a deeper understanding of the data analysis and machine learning process.
